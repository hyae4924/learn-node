## Features of Express JS

1. <b>Middleware</b><br>

- Middleware functions are functions<br>
  that have access to the request object (req),<br>
  the response object (res),<br>
  and the next function in the application’s request-response cycle
- express를 간단히 말하면 미들웨어함수의 연속이라 볼 수 있다<br>
  미들웨어라함수는 특정 요구에대해 처리할 수있게,<br>
  말하자면 거쳐가는 함수들이라 생각하면 된다<br>
- express의 method는 미들웨어를 방식으로 동작한다

2. <b>Routing </b><br>

- It refers to how an application's endpoint's URLs respond<br>
  to client requests.
- you define routing using methods of the Express app object<br>
  that correspond to HTTP methods

3. <b>Templating : for SSR </b><br>

- It provides templating engines<br>
  to build dynamic content on the web pages<br>
  by creating HTML templates on the server.

4. <b>Debugging </b>
   Express makes it easier <br>
   as it identifies the exact part where bugs are.
